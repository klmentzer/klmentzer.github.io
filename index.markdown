# Hi, I'm Kaleigh Mentzer.
My name is Katherine Leigh Mentzer, but I go by Kaleigh. 

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Irene Lo and Itai Ashlagi. My dissertation work focused on using Operations Research tools to improve student assignment algorithms in the San Francisco Unified School District, and our research has influenced educational policy in the district. I enjoy working with stakeholders to formulate, execute, and communicate solutions to computationally difficult algorithmic and optimization-based problems, and I'm passionate about using computational tools to improve equity of access to education.

Before Stanford, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Dartmouth College with a BA in Physics (with Honors) and a minor in Economics.

Right now, I'm excited about geospatial data, and I'm interested in drawing insights from the HCI community to better communicate computational results.
